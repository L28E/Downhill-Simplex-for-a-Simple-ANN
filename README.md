# Downhill-Simplex-for-a-Simple-ANN
Assignment 3 for ELEC 5404. An implementation of the Nelderâ€“Mead method, and using it to train a very simple neural net.

The simple NN to demonstrate is a model of the $V_{GS}$, $V_{DS}$ surface for a given FET, i.e. the current through some FET as a function of gate-source and drain-source voltage.
